Awesome — here’s a very detailed, one-day build spec for the AI Support Reply Suggestor you can ship at a hackathon and charge for with Stripe Checkout. It’s scoped to be realistic in a single day while leaving clear hooks for “Day 2+” growth.

AI Support Reply Suggestor — 1-Day MVP Spec
0) TL;DR

What ships today: A web app where a support rep pastes a customer message → selects tone → clicks Generate → gets 2–3 AI reply drafts → one-click “Copy”.

Billing: Stripe Checkout for “Unlimited replies” (free plan = 5/day soft limit).

Stack: Next.js + Vercel, API routes (Node), OpenAI API, Stripe.

No DB required (ship fast). Optional: add Upstash Redis / Supabase if you want server-side rate limits or a paid flag.

1) Product Scope (Day-1)
Core user stories (acceptance criteria)

Paste & Generate

Given: a text area with a pasted customer email.

When: I choose a Tone (Friendly / Professional / Concise) and click Generate.

Then: I see 3 reply drafts within ~3s (each <150 words), each with a Copy button.

Free vs Paid gating

Given: I’m on free tier.

When: I generate replies more than 5 times in a day.

Then: The Generate button disables and a modal prompts me to Upgrade (Stripe Checkout link).

Checkout

Given: I click Upgrade.

When: Stripe Checkout completes.

Then: I land on a /thank-you page explaining how to unlock unlimited usage (manual unlock code OR auto via webhook if implemented).

Basic safety

AI replies never invent policy details and include a brief clarifying question if information is missing.

Toxic/abusive customer inputs are defused politely.

Definition of Done (Day-1): Deployed app on Vercel, working generation, working soft free limit, Stripe Checkout link live, and a polished demo flow.

2) Architecture

Frontend: Next.js (App Router) + Tailwind
Server: Next.js API routes (Node runtime)
AI: OpenAI text generation endpoint
Payments: Stripe Checkout (one “Pro” product/price)
State: LocalStorage (free-count), HTTP-only cookie (session id).
Optional: Upstash Redis or Supabase for server-side rate limit & paid flag; Stripe webhook.

Data flow (MVP)

User pastes message → POST /api/generate with { message, tone, lang? }.

Server calls OpenAI with a structured prompt → returns 3 replies.

Frontend renders reply cards → Copy.

Frontend increments local free-use counter; if >5 → show Upgrade modal.

Upgrade → /api/create-checkout-session → Stripe hosted Checkout → redirect to /thank-you.

3) UI/UX (minimal, clean, demo-ready)

Header: Logo + “Upgrade” button (ghost style) + “Pro” badge if paid (day-1: fake after checkout).

Main card:

Textarea (min 8 rows) for customer message.

Tone select: Friendly / Professional / Concise (radio buttons).

(Optional) Language: Auto / English / French / Spanish.

Generate button (shows spinner).

Results grid: 3 reply cards

Header: “Draft A / B / C”

Body: AI text

Footer: “Copy” button + “Shorten/Expand” secondary action (optional).

Footer: “Free: 5 replies/day. Unlimited with Pro.”

Empty-state copy (above the fold):

“Paste a customer email. Get 3 polished replies in seconds. Keep the human, skip the typing.”

4) Prompts (copy-paste ready)
System prompt
You are a senior customer support agent. You write clear, empathetic, policy-safe replies.
You NEVER invent product details or policies. If critical info is missing, you ask one concise clarifying question.
You avoid legal promises and do not offer refunds unless explicitly stated by the user's message.
Keep each reply under 150 words. Use the target tone and keep brand-agnostic language.
If the input contains abuse, stay calm and de-escalate politely.

User prompt (template)
CUSTOMER MESSAGE:
"""
{{message}}
"""

CONTEXT:
- Tone: {{tone}}  (one of: Friendly, Professional, Concise)
- Language: {{language}}  (e.g., Auto or "English")

TASK:
Generate 3 different reply drafts to the customer. 
Rules:
- Each draft must be self-contained, helpful, and <150 words.
- If information is missing (order #, plan, dates, etc.), ask one clarifying question near the end.
- No hallucinated policy or product details.
- Keep tone = {{tone}}.
- If original message is in another language, reply in that language unless Language is set to English.
Return JSON with keys "drafts": [ "text1", "text2", "text3" ].

Model params (start here)

temperature: 0.5 (balanced creativity)

max_tokens: ~400 (3 drafts under 150w each)

top_p: 1

presence_penalty: 0 / frequency_penalty: 0.2 (reduce repetition)

5) API Design
POST /api/generate

Body: { message: string, tone: "Friendly"|"Professional"|"Concise", language?: "Auto"|"English"|"French"|... }

Auth: none (hackathon), but read a session cookie for telemetry/rate-limit if you add it.

Logic:

Validate inputs (min length, strip HTML).

Call OpenAI with system/user prompts above.

Parse JSON response; fallback to safe text if JSON parse fails.

Return { drafts: string[] }.

Example (pseudo-TS)

// /app/api/generate/route.ts
import { NextResponse } from "next/server";
import OpenAI from "openai";

export async function POST(req: Request) {
  const { message, tone = "Friendly", language = "Auto" } = await req.json();
  if (!message || message.trim().length < 10) {
    return NextResponse.json({ error: "Message too short" }, { status: 400 });
  }

  const client = new OpenAI({ apiKey: process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY! });

  const system = `...system prompt from spec...`;
  const user = `...user prompt template filled with ${message}/${tone}/${language}...`;

  const resp = await client.chat.completions.create({
    model: process.env.OPENAI_MODEL || "gpt-4o-mini",
    temperature: 0.5,
    max_tokens: 400,
    messages: [
      { role: "system", content: system },
      { role: "user", content: user }
    ]
  });

  const text = resp.choices?.[0]?.message?.content ?? "";
  // Try JSON parse, fallback to split by \n\n if needed
  let drafts: string[] = [];
  try {
    const j = JSON.parse(text);
    drafts = j.drafts?.slice(0,3) ?? [];
  } catch {
    drafts = text.split(/\n\n+/).slice(0,3);
  }

  return NextResponse.json({ drafts });
}

POST /api/create-checkout-session

Body: { plan: "pro" }

Logic: Create Stripe Checkout Session (mode: subscription or one-time for hackathon), return url.

// /app/api/create-checkout-session/route.ts
import Stripe from "stripe";
import { NextResponse } from "next/server";

export async function POST() {
  const stripe = new Stripe(process.env.STRIPE_SECRET_KEY!, { apiVersion: "2024-06-20" as any });

  const session = await stripe.checkout.sessions.create({
    mode: "subscription", // or "payment" for one-time
    line_items: [{ price: process.env.STRIPE_PRICE_ID!, quantity: 1 }],
    success_url: `${process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_URL}/thank-you`,
    cancel_url: `${process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_URL}/`,
    allow_promotion_codes: true
  });

  return NextResponse.json({ url: session.url });
}

(Optional) POST /api/stripe-webhook

Purpose: Mark user/session as paid.

Day-1 shortcut: Skip webhook → on Thank You page, show a temporary unlock code (“PRO-DEMO-2025”) the judges can enter to turn on unlimited for their session (stored in localStorage).

Day-2: Add webhook + Redis/Supabase to persist paid = true for the session/user.

6) Rate Limiting & Gating (Day-1)

Soft limit: Track freeGenerationsToday in localStorage keyed by date.

After each /api/generate, increment. If > 5, disable Generate and open Upgrade modal.

Pros: zero backend work, perfect for demo.

Cons: not secure → acceptable for hackathon.

Day-2 (optional):

Set a signed session cookie on first visit.

Store counts in Upstash Redis keyed by sessionId:yyyy-mm-dd.

Stripe webhook updates paid:<sessionId>=true.

7) Stripe Setup

Create product: “Support Reply Pro”

Price: $39/month (change later)

Billing: monthly, trial: none (or 7 days if you want).

Get IDs: STRIPE_SECRET_KEY, NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY, STRIPE_PRICE_ID.

Environment (.env.local):

OPENAI_API_KEY=...
OPENAI_MODEL=gpt-4o-mini
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_live_or_test...
NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_live_or_test...
STRIPE_PRICE_ID=price_12345
NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_URL=https://yourapp.vercel.app

8) Cost & Performance Guardrails

Token budget: 400–600 tokens per request total → a few cents on mini models.

Hard limits: truncation if message.length > 2,500 chars (prompt warns user to shorten).

Timeouts: 15s server timeout; show retry button.

9) Security & Privacy (quick wins)

Strip HTML & scripts from inputs.

Don’t log raw messages server-side (only request IDs + duration).

Add a brief Privacy note in footer: “We don’t store your messages. They are sent to our AI provider for generation, then discarded.”

10) Error Handling UX

Model error / 429 → toast: “Model is busy. Try again.”

Bad input → inline validation under textarea (min 10 chars).

Network fail → “Retry” button; preserve input.

Empty drafts → show a safe fallback draft: apology + clarifying question.

11) Analytics (Day-1 lightweight)

Client-side console.log + basic window.plausible or PostHog snippet (pageview, generate_clicked, upgrade_clicked).

Server: log only counts & durations (no PII).

12) Deployment Steps

npx create-next-app@latest support-reply

Add Tailwind: npx tailwindcss init -p (follow Next/Tailwind quickstart).

Implement /app/page.tsx UI, /api/generate, /api/create-checkout-session.

Set env vars in Vercel project.

git push → Vercel deploy.

Test Stripe Checkout in test mode.

Ship.

13) Polished Demo Script (for judges)

Paste an angry email about a late order.

Choose Friendly tone → Generate → show 3 drafts in ~2–3s.

Click Copy → paste into Gmail → (optional) minor edit → send.

Hit Generate 5 times → see Upgrade prompt.

Click Upgrade → Stripe Checkout → Thank You → enter unlock code → unlimited enabled.

Close: “Today it’s copy-paste. Tomorrow we push drafts directly into Gmail/Zendesk and learn from your KB. Same speed, even less friction.”

14) Hour-by-Hour Plan (realistic)

Hour 1 — Repo, Tailwind, basic layout, header/footer.
Hour 2 — Textarea + Tone controls + “Generate” button; skeleton result cards.
Hour 3 — /api/generate endpoint with OpenAI; wire up client; render drafts.
Hour 4 — LocalStorage free-limit logic + Upgrade modal.
Hour 5 — Stripe Checkout endpoint + button + /thank-you page with unlock code input.
Hour 6 — Empty/error states, truncation, loading spinners, copy buttons, polish.
Hour 7 — Basic analytics, privacy blurb, final copy, lighthouse pass.
Hour 8 — Full run-throughs, record demo, contingency fixes.

15) Stretch (if time remains)

Language auto-detect (model call #1: “what language?”) and reply in same.

Shorten/Expand buttons per draft (call model with edit prompt).

Saved Replies (localStorage array; export as CSV).

Gmail Drafts integration (send reply to Drafts via Google API OAuth — likely Day-2).

16) Risks & Mitigations

Hallucinated policy → strong system rules + “don’t invent” + encourage clarifying question.

Latency spikes → keep prompts short, use “mini/fast” models, show spinner + optimistic UI.

Abuse/toxicity → de-escalation rules + optional pre-filter (“If input contains slurs, don’t mirror them”).

Rate-limit circumvention → acceptable at hackathon; fix with Redis later.

17) Ready-to-paste UI Copy

Hero: “Reply to customers 5× faster. Paste email → get 3 polished drafts.”

CTA: “Generate replies (free)” / “Upgrade to Pro (unlimited)”

Footnote: “We don’t store your messages. They’re sent to our AI provider to generate replies, then discarded.”

18) What “Day-2” Looks Like (brief)

Add Gmail Drafts + Zendesk app (browser extension or OAuth app).

Add KB ingestion (upload FAQ PDF/URL; store vectors; augment prompts).

Add team seats + webhook-based Pro flag + Redis rate limits.

Add analytics (AHT, CSAT proxy, tone usage, macro library).
